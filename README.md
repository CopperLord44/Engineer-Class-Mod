# Engineer-Class-Mod
Engineer Mod adds a new class, the Engineer class.  -This class uses both ranged weapons, melee and summon but all using engineer damage.  -The weapons have tiers from 0 to 8.  -Weapons can be customized using attachments.    -Depending on the combinations of attachments you use, the weapon can change completely. A shotgun, minigun, or snipper.  -We accept all ideas as it is an early development mod. How are attachments obtained? You can craft them in the COMPRESSOR, which is purchased from the npc engineer who comes to your city after killing the eye of cthulu.  In the compressor you will use as crafting materials plates, pipes, gears etc which are obtained by scrapping weapons of any type in the corresponding menu of the npc engineer.
